Example
-------

```
DEBUG [33031a43fc244539895fef70c433337e] myproject.apps.myapp.views: Doing something in a view
DEBUG [33031a43fc244539895fef70c433337e] myproject.apps.myapp.forms: The form validated successfully!
DEBUG [33031a43fc244539895fef70c433337e] myproject.apps.myapp.models: Doing some model magic
DEBUG [33031a43fc244539895fef70c433337e] myproject.apps.myapp.views: Redirecting to form success page
```

Why?
----

So you can grep (or otherwise search) a set of logs for a high-traffic application to isolate all messages associated with a single request.

How?
----

**The request ID is stored in a thread local**. Use of thread locals is not generally considered best practice for Django applications, but seems to be the only viable approach in this case. Pull requests with better ideas are welcome.

Any other neat features?
------------------------

In some cases, components further up the HTTP stack such as load balancers or proxies may generate request IDs. For example, [Heroku's http-request-id feature](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-request-id) adds a header to the request called `X_REQUEST_ID`. If such a header is present (and configured in your settings, see below), this ID will be used (instead of generating one). You can configure your settings to use a generated ID or return a default request_id when you expect the ID in the request header but it is not available.

The ID also gets added to the `HttpRequest` object that is handed to your views (as `request.id`), in case you need to use it in your application.

Installation and usage
----------------------

First, install the package: `pip install django-log-request-id`

Add the middleware to your `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` setting. It should be at the very top.

```python
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    'log_request_id.middleware.RequestIDMiddleware',
    # ... other middleware goes here
)
```

Add the `log_request_id.filters.RequestIDFilter` to your `LOGGING` setting. You'll also need to update your `formatters` to include a format with the new `request_id` variable, add a handler to output the messages (eg to the console), and finally attach the handler to your application's logger.

If none of the above made sense, study [Django's logging documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/logging/).

Here is a complete `LOGGING` setting. Note that the key `filters` occurs twice.

```python
LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'filters': {
        'request_id': {
            '()': 'log_request_id.filters.RequestIDFilter'
        }
    },
    'formatters': {
        'standard': {
            'format': '%(levelname)-8s [%(asctime)s] [%(request_id)s] %(name)s: %(message)s'
        },
    },
    'handlers': {
        'console': {
            'level': 'DEBUG',
            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
            'filters': ['request_id'],
            'formatter': 'standard',
        },
    },
    'loggers': {
        'myapp': {
            'handlers': ['console'],
            'level': 'DEBUG',
            'propagate': False,
        },
    }
}
```

You can then output log messages as usual:

```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.debug("A wild log message appears!")
```

If you wish to use an ID provided in a request header, add the following setting:

```python
LOG_REQUEST_ID_HEADER = "HTTP_X_REQUEST_ID"
```

Setting this value as above will enable requests having the header `X-Request-Id` to be logged with the header value supplied.

Note that this value must conform to the format for [Django META keys](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpRequest.META), otherwise it will be ignored.

If you wish to fall back to a generated ID when you have the `LOG_REQUEST_ID_HEADER` set but it was not provided in the request, add the following setting:

```python
GENERATE_REQUEST_ID_IF_NOT_IN_HEADER = True
```

If you wish to include the request id in the response headers, add the following setting, where `RESPONSE_HEADER_NAME` is the name of the custom header you are going to use:

```python
REQUEST_ID_RESPONSE_HEADER = "RESPONSE_HEADER_NAME"
```

If you wish to change the default `request_id` in the log output, the the following settings, where `none` (default) is the value you want to be the default value in case it's missing.

```python
NO_REQUEST_ID = "none"
```

Logging all requests
--------------------

The `RequestIDMiddleware` also has the ability to log all requests received by the application, including some useful information such as the user ID (if present). To enable this feature, add `LOG_REQUESTS = True` to your settings. The messages are sent to the `log_request_id.middleware` logger at `INFO` level.

Logging other user attributes
--------------------

If you would like to log another user attribute instead of user ID, this can be specified with the `LOG_USER_ATTRIBUTE` setting. Eg. to log the username, use: `LOG_USER_ATTRIBUTE = "username"`
